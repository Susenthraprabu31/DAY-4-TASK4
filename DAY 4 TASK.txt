2.READ ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE WINDOW, SCREEN AND DOCUMENT IN JAVASCRIPT


1.WINDOW

The window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser 
This window object has the majority of the properties like length, inner Width, inner Height, name, if it has been closed, its parents, and more.
The JavaScript window object sits at the top of the JavaScript Object hierarchy and represents the browser window. 

2.SCREEN


Screen is a small information object about physical screen dimensions . It can be used to display screen width, height, colorDepth, pixelDepth etc.
It is not mandatory to write window prefix with screen object. It can be written without window prefix.

3.DOCUMENT

When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser , it becomes a document object. It is the root node of the HTML document. 
The Document interface represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web pageâ€™s content, which is the DOM tree.
 The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc.
